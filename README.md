# FriendFinder
In this activity, you'll build a compatibility-based "FriendFinder" application -- basically a dating app. This full-stack site will take in results from your users' surveys, then compare their answers with those from other users. The app will then display the name and picture of the user with the best overall match.

1. What the project does:
In this project we created a friend finder app through our own local server and deployed it to Heroku.

2. Why the project is useful:
This project is useful because it teaches us how to build a full-stack site that takes in results from a user and compares their answers to others.

3. How users can get started with the project:
Users can get started with this project by connecting to their local servers as well as build out their routes needed for the project.

4. Where users can get help with your project:
If users need help with the project then they can go to my repo and review the code.

5. Who maintains and contributes to the project:
This project was maintained and contributed by Will Altherr.  In order for me to complete this project I had to use resources online including other repositories that have completed this project.
